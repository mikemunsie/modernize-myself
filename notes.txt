Things I like about React and Redux:

- Redux Dev Tools: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-getting-started-with-redux-dev-tools
  (add: createStore(combineReducers(Reducers), {}, window.devToolsExtension ? window.devToolsExtension() : undefined))

- Actions: information that send data from your app to the store.
- Action Creators are functions that create actions.
- Reducers: How the applications state changes in response
  - Handling actions: reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and returns the next state

pizzaApp: {
  customers: [],
  location: {}
}

function myApp(state = pizzaApp, action) {
  return state;
}
